For this project I created a basic brick breaker game! Brick breaker was a childhood favorite of mine!

This app was created in Xcode and has one basic level. There is a score keeper which will increase each time the ball hits a brick. Since the score is rather large on the screen a nice touch is that the ball goes behind the score counter. There is a win and lose screen which I have shown in the screen shots.:
